# Booking Table Partitioning Performance Report

## Implementation Overview
- Partitioned the Booking table by `check_in_date` using RANGE partitioning
- Created yearly partitions for 2023-2025 plus a default future partition
- Maintained all existing constraints and indexes
- Migrated data from original Booking table

## Performance Tests

### Test Query 1: Fetch bookings for Q1 2023
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT * FROM Booking_Partitioned 
WHERE check_in_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31';
